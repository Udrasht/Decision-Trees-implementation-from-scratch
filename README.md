# Decision Tree Implementation

This repository provides a tailored implementation of the Decision Tree algorithm, incorporating diverse impurity measurement methods such as Gini index, entropy, and misclassification error. The core implementation is available in a Jupyter Notebook file named `Decision Tree Imp.ipynb`.

## Key Features

- **Custom Decision Tree Implementation:** We have devised a Decision Tree algorithm supporting various impurity methods.
  
- **Tree Visualization:** Explore the visual representation of the decision tree to enhance understanding.

- **Comparison with scikit-learn:** Evaluate and compare the results with the Decision Tree implementation from the scikit-learn library.

## Installation

To run the Jupyter Notebook and experiment with the Decision Tree implementation, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
